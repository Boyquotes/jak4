	* The man smiles as you approach.
	{remember("He seems friendly enough")} Are your housings satisfactory?
	We made sure to get wardrobe, as asked.
	[You] Yes, thank you. It's perfect. So about the Medium?
	{remember("He must be the little fellow by the Medium, like the landlord said.", "Armstrong")} Armstrong is out beside the machine, with the goggles. He knows it better than everyone.

	Say, if you do not mind me prying, who did you talk with in there?
	> Uh, sorry, I can't get into it right now.
		Oh, no worries! Eh, enjoy the lodgings!
	> For my mum.
		Oh. I understand. You must miss her terribly.
		> I suppose I do...
			You are awfully young for such loss.
			When did she pass?
			> When I was very young. Just a baby.
				I'm sure she would have wished to see you now. That she left so soon is an tragedy for both of you.
				[You] ... it is.
			> I don't know, exactly.
				You don't?
				[You] No. She left after I was born, and nobody could ever contact her again, so we assume she died.
				> {skip()} I hope she died.
					[You] +{mum/absent}I h--
					[You] .... 
					[You] I have to go, sorry.
				> I hope I can get more answers from the Medium.
					I hope you do as well. It sounds like you have many questions for her.
					[You] ...
		> {skip()} Honestly, no.
			[You] +{mum/absent} Honestly, no. I didn't know her well enough to miss her, per se. It's more...
			> {skip()} Anger
				[You] Anger. Or, frustration, I suppose. I know so little about her. She left behind no photographs, no letters, no family or friends besides my father. I'm not even certain she died.
				You're not?
				[You] No! She left without any notice, supposedly right after I was weaned off milk.
				[You] I came all the way out here, at considerable expense, to learn where she went and why.
			> {skip()} Emptiness
				[You] Emptiness? A void? It feels like I missed a chunk of my life without her.
			> {skip()} Envy
				[You] I always felt so envious of my friends. Their mothers were just there. All the time! And almost everything I heard was complaining!
				[You] "Mum isn't letting me go out tonight!" "My mother's so stupid!"
				[You] I tried as hard as I could to keep it

	Did you need anything?
	[You] Not right now, thanks.
	Ok, I will be around if you need.

	[You] Could we trade coats again?
	You gave me this one? You want it again?
	> Never mind, it looks good on you!
		Oh, okay.
	> Yes, you can have the one I'm wearing.
		Every guest has their needs.
		{swap_coats()} Here you go.
		[You] Wonderful, thank you!
{otherwise}
	[You] So, there's something you could do for me.
	Repairs? Errands? As my guest, I will help with whatever you need.
	[You] I'd like your coat.
	... Pardon?
	> Never mind. It's an odd request.
		.. Uh, well. if you need anything else, let me know.
	> I'd like to trade my coat for yours. That fabric is lovely.
		I've never had such a request before.
		{swap_coats()} Well, it's no problem for me. I hope you enjoy.
		[You] Thank you dearly! It looks great!
