	* A payphone rings. Nobody seems interested in answering.
	* You pick up the receiver.

	Jackie, love! How's the signal?
	You -- .. Persephone? How in God's name did you know I was here?
	[note: persephonie/intro | My old friend Persephone somehow called me by payphone? | persephone]
	?introduction> I don't think we've spoken since you, um, left the college. How's life been?
		Longer than I was expecting, personally.
		// Would they go to universities? How authentic do I want this?
		[note: persephone/school | We were old friends in board school, and eventually went to the same college: the Women's College of Godhead in Grahamshire. She was expelled before we finished. She never told me what she did, and nobody I asked seemed to know, either. |+ persephone]
		Anyway!
		[back]
	I tried to pay a visit and you were gone. Your father told me about the trip to Yaqaz. That wasn't meant to be a secret, was it?
	You -- No, no. What I mean is, how did you know I was at this /exact/ payphone?
	Oh, that was no trouble. The word "Perception" comes from "Persephone", after all.
	You -- ... What?
	?introduction> Persephone, I really do need an answer. How did you know which phone to call?
		Love, someday you'll have secrets of your own, and I'll be so happy for you.
		Now, as I was saying...

	Anyway love, I actually live around there, so I thought
	You -- What? A gift?

	[Global add_note: Persephone's gift is at Muzna Cross, Line 5, Apartment 8 (mint green). The door takes a code: 794. |+ gift_from_persephone muzna_cross]
	You -- ... Alright, I've put it down in my journal.
	Excellent! Let me know when you've got it! After that, maybe I can give you a tour of the place!
	[Global add_note: She apparently wants to give me a tour of the area? I'm not sure how that'd work. |+ persephone]

	// You find a little decorative vase. That's the gift.
	// Persephone calls you again, explaining you can also use the apartment if you want.
